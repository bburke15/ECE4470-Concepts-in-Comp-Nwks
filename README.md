# ECE4470-Protocol-Stack
mplemented a four-layer reference model (where layer 4 is the top-most application layer and layer 1 is the bottom-most physical layer) for communication between two hosts in C. Any instance of the program runs in either send or receive mode. When in send mode, the program divides a sendfile up into packets (max size 120 bytes before stuffing), adds headers and trailers, inserts a stuffed DLE character before any occurrence of a control character (STX, ETX, or DLE) in the data portion of each packet (max packet size is 180 bytes after stuffing), and transmits the packets to the inputted receiver IP address. When in receive mode, the program performs a checksum on each packet to ensure no data was corrupted in transit, removes stuffed characters from the data portion of each frame as well as all headers and trailers, and writes the data to an outfile. Project was completed in three phases. First, the basic sending and receiving packet operations (across layers 2-4) were implemented. Second, checksumming and DLE character stuffing were implemented. Finally, sending and receiving IP addresses (provided by the user) were integrated into the L3PDU to make transmission and reception of packets between two different host computers possible. The third and most recent phase of the project (which includes all functionality from the prior two phases) is included here.
